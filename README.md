# LeXx Bot
_A free and easy to use bot_

---
## Music
A **simple music module** for listening to music while talking to your friends. Just search YouTube or feed LeXx with an URL.

## Logging
Want to have the **full controller and overview** over the mods and what users are doing on your server? No problem: use LeXx’ log feature.
By the way, LeXx saves every message up to 2 minutes after sending / editing if the message log is enabled for showing the content on deleting it!

## Fun
Every bot needs some **cool features** like random selected users, a roll or ping feature. LeXx is capable of doing all this stuff and even more!
Keep an eye on secrets ;)

## Moderation
You don‘t want to delete 80 messages separately or edit all permissions of a user to mute him? Fixed! Just use the moderation commands like `.clear`, `.mute` and `.kick` ...
Notice: Only selected roles can use these commands!

## Role Management
New users should get a role automatically? With LeXx you can give a role on join and even add roles to members after a certain amount of time. This is especially handy if you want to avoid spamming from new users or need to indentify them.

## GUI
Did you know? LeXx doesn’t need a webinterface, because its settings are managed in Discord with the **reaction-systems**. You do not have to spam commands anymore to set up the bot!
